===

Fork of the original original [placebooks project](https://github.com/horizon-institute/Bridging-the-Rural-Divide--Placebooks), used as a baseline to create the [ReminiscensBook](https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscens-book), a remix that provides a book oriented UI for [reminiscens](https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscens)

This forked is created to have a connection to the original project, in case we ever want to contribute something back to it. The main changes, however, will be available in the [ReminiscensBook](https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscens-book) repository.
